Revision history for Tesla-Vehicle

0.08    2022-07-18
    - Return 0 if charge_actual_current() is undef
    - Bump prereq of Tesla::API for changes addressing Tesla API timeout issues
    - Added address(); converts lat/lon into human readable street address
      information

0.07    2022-03-31
    - Added PR#7; Add set_charge_limit() and examples/control.pl (Thanks
      @ankratochvil !)
    - Added PR#5; Update example scripts with shebang line (Thanks
      @ankratochvil !)
    - Add POD for set_charge_limit()
    - Update example shebang lines to use /usr/bin/env perl
    - Renamed set_charge_limit() to charge_limit_set()
    - Add Tesla API retries (API_RETRIES) if 'gear' is undefined (closes #1)
    - Add DEBUG_TESLA_API_RETRY to output info about API retries
    - If a vehicle is parked, 'speed' is undefined, so we return 0 in this case
    - Add new 'gear' return value, 'U', for when we've retried the API call but
      still haven't got a defined value

0.06    2022-03-23
    - Return instead of print the return value of options()
    - Bump prereq of Tesla::API to 0.09; its api() method now requires all
      parameters (endpoint, id, api_params thus far) to be sent in as a hash
      as opposed to positional scalars

0.05    2022-03-22
    - Fix issue where instead of timing out the wake() call properly, we were
      repeatedly displaying the timeout notice, then doing nothing which
      resulted in an uninit warning being thrown (fixes #4)
    - Renamed option_codes() to options(). Tesla::API now handles option_codes()
    - options() now returns an href of code => description pairs

0.04    2022-03-21

    - Upper-cased method headers in POD
    - _online_check() "not awake" warning now only executes if auto_wake is

    - Added charging_stations_nearby()
    - Added several command methods to actually operate the vehicle
    - Updated Tesla::API to accept body content parameters for the new command
      methods, therefore bumped prereq to v0.03
